# Agentic AI Frameworks

## Not Using a Framework

So far we havent been using any frameworks

    - have just been connecting using the API with our own logic


This gives you granular control over the application and direction


__MCP__

MCP is not a framework

    - it allows you to connect models to external tools to increase their functionality


Open-source protocol to connect models and external sources

    - it's a protocol, no "glue" code


## Basic Frameworks

Lighter, more basic and to-the-point frameworks

__OpenAI Agents SDK__

Lightweight, flexible framework

    - newer, APIs may change


__CrewAI__

Easy to use, low-code, config-based approach

    - more static, a bit heavier


## Complex Frameworks

More complex, in-depth frameworks

Steep learning curves

Powerful, can build sophisticated systems

    - can be locked into project ecosystems


__LangGraph__
